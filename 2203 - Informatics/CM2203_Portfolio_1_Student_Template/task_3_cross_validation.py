# This function takes in the data for cross evaluation and the number of partitions to split the data into.
# As input, the function takes:
# - training_data     - a pandas DataFrame containing the data set to be split
# - f                 - the number of partitions to split the data into, value is greater than 0,
#                       not guaranteed to be smaller than data size. If f exceeds the size of the data,
#                       cap it at data size.
# As output, it produces:
# - partition_list   - a list of pandas DataFrames, where each data frame represents a partition, so a subset of entries
#                     of the original dataset s.t. all partitions are disjoint, roughly same size (can differ by
#                     at most 1), and the union of all partitions equals the original dataset. The indexing must be
#                     preserved - i.e. row with row name/index 12 in the original dataset will have
#                     same name whatever partition it is in. The column and row names in the partition must be the same
#                     as in training_data.

# At input, the function takes:
# - partition_list - a list of data frames, where each data frame represents a partition (see partition_data function)
# - f - the number of folds to use in cross-validation, which is the same as the number of partitions
#       the data was supposed to be split to, and the number of rounds in cross-validation. Value is greater than 0.
#
# The function produces:
# - folds - a list of 3-tuple s.t. the first element is the round number, second is the training data for that round,
#           and third is the testing data for that round. The round numbers START WITH 0.
#           The indexing must be preserved - i.e. row with row name/index 12 in the original dataset will have
#           same name whatever fold it is in

# In this task you are expected to perform and evaluate cross-validation on a given dataset.
# You are expected to partition the input dataset into f partitions, then arrange them into training and testing
# data for each cross validation round, and then train and execute naive Bayes for each round using this data.
#
# You are then asked to produce an output dataset which extends the original input training_data by adding
# "PredictedClass" and "Fold" columns, which for each entry state what class it got predicted when it
# landed in a testing fold and what the number of that fold was (remember, numbering starts from 0). This
# is paired with a dictionary listing average evaluation measures.

# At input, the function takes:
# - nb - naive Bayes classifier from Task 1
# - training_data - a pandas DataFrame representing the data
# - partition_func - the function used to partition the input dataset (by default, it is the one above)
# - prep_func - the function used to transform the partitions into appropriate folds

# As output, it produces a tuple consisting of
# - output_dataset - a pandas DataFrame which extends the original input training_data by adding "PredictedClass"
#                    and "Fold" columns, which for each entry state what class it got predicted when it
#                    landed in a testing fold and what the number of that fold was (numbering starts from 0).
# - evaluation metrics - average evaluation metrics as produced by eval_func
