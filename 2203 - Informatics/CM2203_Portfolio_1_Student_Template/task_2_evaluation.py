# Task 2 [10 points out of 40] Classifier evaluation
# This task focuses on evaluating the naïve Bayes classifier from Task 1. On your own, implement binary precision,
# recall and f-measure, as well as their macro and weighted counterparts.
# You are also asked to implement the multiclass version of accuracy, and its weighted counterpart. You
# need to follow the formulas covered in the module. Remember to be mindful of edge cases (the approach for handling
# them is explained in lecture slides).
# Please note that this template also contains empty functions pertaining to
# creating a confusion matrix and calculating TPs, FPs and FNs based on it. These will be implemented during the
# practicals, with the code to be released later. They are not a part of the marking criteria.

# This function computes the confusion matrix based on the provided series of actual and predicted classes.
# The returned data frame must contain appropriate column and row names, and be filled with integers.
# The columns correspond to actual classes and rows to predicted classes, in the sense that the i-th row
# is the row representing how often entries actually belonging to some class, were predicted as the i-th class value;
# the i-th column represents how often entries predicted as some other class, actually belonged to the i-th class.
#
# At input, function takes:
# - actual_class, predicted_class - series of class values representing actual and predicted classes of some dataset.
#                                   NOT guaranteed to contain all possible class values from the classification schema.
# - class_values - all possible values of the class from which actual_class and predicted_class were drawn.
#
# As output, it produces:
# - matrix : a data frame representing the confusion matrix computed based on the offered series of actual
#            and predicted classes. The data frame must contain appropriate column and row names, and be
#            filled with integers.
