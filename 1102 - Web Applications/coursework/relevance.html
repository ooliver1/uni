    More recently, Linux has become increasingly popular as a desktop operating system. This has brought about many open source
    projects that support this such as Window Managers, Desktop Environments, and Software Applications. Linux has also become
    popular in the cloud computing industry, with many cloud providers offering Linux-based virtual machines and containers,
    due to the increased performance and software support for server based applications.
  </p>
  Linux is widely used today in many forms, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Web Servers - Ubuntu Server</li>
    <li>Desktop Computers - Debian, Ubuntu</li>
    <li>Mobile Devices - Android, ChromeOS</li>
    <li>Embedded Systems - Raspberry Pi OS</li>
    <li>Gaming Consoles - SteamOS</li>
  </ul>

    Git has also become a widely used tool by software developers. It is used by many large software projects, including the Linux
    kernel itself, VSCode, and Python. Git has become the standard for version control systems due to its wide use and support
    by hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. It is also used to manage the plethora of open source software to
    power the largest tech companies in the world such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, which have many thousands of projects
    maintained by in-house developers, as well as the open source community.
