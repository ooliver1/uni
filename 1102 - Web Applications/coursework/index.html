    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>
      Linus started trying out programming at age 18 on a Commodore VIC-20.
      He got his own PC in 1991 whilst being a student at the University of Helsinki.
      This is where he started to create his own UNIX-based operating system
      as he was not satisfied with the supplied MS-DOS system.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife used to be his student. He set an assignment to compose an e-mail,
      and his wife completed the task and sent an e-mail asking him on a date.
      They have now settled in Portland, Oregon, USA, and have three daughters.
      The birth dates of his daughters are used as magic values for rebooting the Linux kernel.<sup

    </p>
    <h2>Controversies</h2>
    <p>
      Many people have criticized Linus for his aggressive behavior towards other developers.
      He has been known to use strong language towards other developers, usually when contributing
      to the Linux kernel. He describes himself as "not a people person"<sup class="reference"><a
          href="ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and has said that he
      prefers to work alone. This has been acknowledged more recently by stepping down from Linux
      kernel development temporarily in 2018 to focus on his behavior.<sup class="reference"><a
          href="ref-3">[3]</a></sup>
