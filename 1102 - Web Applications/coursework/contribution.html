    Linus Torvalds is best known for creating the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel powers many operating systems,
    including Android, which is the most popular operating system for mobile devices. The Linux kernel also powers
    the majority of web servers, which host websites and web applications due to its stable and secure nature.
    Many consider Linux to be more secure as the source code is open for anyone to audit and improve, leading to quick
    fixes for security vulnerabilities, and even preventing them from being introduced in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Linux kernel is open-source, which means that anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code.
    This has led to the creation of many Linux distributions, which are operating systems that are based on the Linux kernel.
    Some popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.
  </p>

    Linus Torvalds also created Git, which is a distributed version control system. Git is widely used by software developers
    to manage changes to source code. Git is used by many large software projects, including the Linux kernel itself. Git
    was originally created solely for Linux to solve the lack of suitable version control systems available for the project,
    but it has since become one of the most popular version control systems in the world.
