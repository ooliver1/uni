## Remainder Method
For integers, divide by base ($2$) and read remainders bottom up - $11001$
For fractional, multiply by base and read top down

| Initial | Quotient | Remainder |
| ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 25      | 12       | 1         |
| 12      | 6        | 0         |
| 6       | 3        | 0         |
| 3       | 1        | 1         |
| 1       | 0        | 1         |

$83_10$ -> $x_8$

| Initial | Quotient | Remainder |
| ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 83      | 10       | 3         |
| 10      | 1        | 2         |
| 1       | 0        | 1         |
$123_8$
$75_{10}$ -> $x_8$
| Initial | Quotient | Remainder |
| ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 75      | 9        | 3         |
| 9       | 1        | 1         |
| 1       | 0        | 1         |
$113_8$
$1001011_2$
$4B_{16}$
## Rounding
$0.01111_2$ to 4dp is $0.1000$
## Two's Complement
1. Normal binary of magnitude
2. Flip bits
3. Add one
### Example
$-47_{10}$
1. $00101111$
2. $11010000$
3. $11010001$

| Addition   |
| ---------- |
| 00000101   |
| + 11110111 |
| = 11111100 |
