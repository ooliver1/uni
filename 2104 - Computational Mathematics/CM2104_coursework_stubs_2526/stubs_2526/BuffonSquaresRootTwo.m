%% Task 3 - modified version of "Buffon s needle" that drops squares to estimate sqrt(2)
% INPUTS, in order:
% width = the width of the floorboards;
% length = the length of the needles;
% throws = the number of needles thrown.
%
% OUTPUTS, in order:
% r = the estimate of sqrt(2),
% crossings = the number of needles that cross a plank;
%
% NOTE: should you need further input or output variables when integrating 
% the function to the GUI, you must implement the necessary  checks  using
% nargin and nargout to  ensure  the  function  works  correctly  outside 
% the GUI with the input and output combinations specified above.

function [r,crossings] = BuffonSquaresRootTwo(width,length,throws)
    
end
